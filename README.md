# The artisanal mining landscape in DRC

I sought to analyze the data from the interactive map on artisanal mining in DRC by IPIS to find compelling insights into informal mining sector in DRC. I filtered the data to only include mines visited by IPIS after 2020 (the latest available data went to late March 2023). The angles I sought to explore are as follows:

1. Armed group presence: Identify and map the mining sites with an armed group presence to expose potential links between armed conflict and mining activities.
    a. Find which mineral attracts the most armed groups.
2. State/police presence: Identify and map the mining sites with state presence
    a. Check if there’s any overlap with armed group presence.
    b. Find which mineral attracts the most armed groups.
3. Mineral extraction patterns:
    a. Analyze the distribution of different minerals across provinces to understand which provinces are rich in what mineral.
4. Environmental impact: Explore the mining sites that use mercury.
    a. Check if there’s any overlap with armed group presence.
    b. Check if there’s any overlap with child labor.
5. Child labor: Identify sites employing child workers
    a. Check if there’s any overlap with armed group presence.
    b. Which provinces are disproportionately using child labor?
    c. Which minerals are disproportionately being mined with child labor?

I found which provinces are more likely to have an armed group present at their artisanal mines, the 10 most common armed groups at mines, which minerals are predominantly mined by artisanal miners, which minerals are more likely to draw armed groups, the number of gold mines per province and where mercury is most likely to be used.

I collected the data from the interactive database from IPIS (https://ipisresearch-dashboard.shinyapps.io/open_data_app/).

I analyzed the data in Jupyter Notebooks.

As this was my first published project using Github, Jupyter Notebooks, HTML and VS Code all together, this whole process was a huge learning experience.

If I had more time, I would narrow my focus to North Kivu and explore the relationship between various local armed groups and the mines where they are present.
