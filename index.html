      <h1 class="title">The artisanal mining landscape in DRC</h1>
      <p class="byline">Bennett Hanson</p>
      <p>Data is from the International Peace Information Service and filtered to only include the mines visited by investigators in the Democratic Republic of Congo between October 2020 and March 2023.</p>
      <p>An estimated 1 million miners toil as informal, artisanal miners in DRC, a country rich in resources but plagued by over 100 armed groups. Access to the artisanal mining sites — primarily gold, tin, and coltan — is a source of conflict among the armed groups and often their main source of income. Because DRC's army (FARDC), police (PNC), and mining police (PMH) are often present at the mines (and involved in the corruption as well), IPIS includes these state services in the armed group category.</p>
      <p>I analyzed the data from the mines visited by IPIS between October 2020 and March 2023 to look for correlations between the presence of armed groups, the use of mercury, and the use of child labor. See my findings below.</p>
      <p>Explore the IPIS <a href="https://www.ipisresearch.be/mapping/webmapping/drcongo/v6/#-3/28/5/1/1/">interactive map</a> and their <a href="https://ipisresearch-dashboard.shinyapps.io/open_data_app/">database</a>.</p>

    <h2>What are the most common armed groups seen at these mines?</h2>

    <br />

    <strong>It seems like the national army and the police are the most common armed groups present at the mines. How often does the reported armed group belong to a state agency like the army, the police, or the mining police?</strong>

    <br />

    <p>According to my analysis of the data, when there is an armed presence at a mine, 71% of the time, it's the army or the police.</p>

    <br />

    <strong>So, about 71% of the time an armed group is present at an artisanal mining site in DRC, it is a state force. Why is this? What's going on?</strong>

    <br />
    
    <p>The U.S. Department of State's 2022 report on human rights in DRC provides some insight:</p>

    <blockquote>
      "Artisanal mining remained predominantly informal, illicit, and strongly linked to both armed groups and certain elements of the FARDC [the army]. Government officials were often complicit in the smuggling of artisanal mining products, particularly gold, into Uganda and Rwanda. The law prohibits the FARDC from engaging in mineral trade, but the government did not effectively enforce the law. Criminal involvement by some FARDC units and armed groups included protection rackets, extortion, and theft. The illegal trade in minerals was both a symptom and a cause of weak governance. It illegally financed armed groups and individual elements of the SSF [state security forces] and sometimes generated revenue for traditional authorities and local and provincial governments. A June report by the UN Group of Experts reported that FARDC members trafficked and profited from untagged coltan in North Kivu Province and illegally mined and taxed gold in Ituri Province. Individual FARDC commanders also sometimes appointed civilians to manage their interests at mining sites covertly."
    </blockquote>

    <br />

    <strong>Are state forces (FARDC, PNC or PMH) ever present alongside a local armed group?</strong>

    <br />

    <p>Yes, at just three mines. The army (FARDC) was seen alongside Maï-Maï Malaika at the Yovoti and Bizola gold mines in Maniema province, and alongside the UPLC at the Mazembe gold mine in Nortk Kivu province.</p>
